AOP: Aspect oriented programming


Spring AOP:

LoanService     loginAspect    => ProxyClass
                Transaction       LoanService

    List<MethodBeforeAdvice> list = new AL<>
   issueLoan(){
   		list.stream().forEach(l -> l.before());
   		super.issueLoan();
   		list1.stream().forEach(l->l.afterRetruning());
   } 
 	
 }
 

 what method body

 Advice:
 @Before

 @AfterReturning

		}

	}
	
	
Advice: (what & when) the job of an aspect
	@Before
	@After
	@AfteReturning
	@AfterThrowing
	@Around
	
	
JoinPoint: (where) a point in execution of the application where and aspect can be plugged in

Pointcut: one or more joinpoints at which advice should be woven

Aspect:  is a merger of advice & pointcut

proxy: the object created after applying advice to the target object

weaving: the process of applying aspects to create a new proxied object
